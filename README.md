# Agentic-AI-Workflow-with-Parallel-and-Series-LLMs

# Project caption: 
Parallel and series LLM chains using Agentic AI pipelines

# Project overview:
In current AI domain, agentic behavior plays critical roles for finding diverse AI applications. AI agents carry out logical reasoning, manage more than one responsibility, and control workflows. In this project I made agentic pipelines where LLMs chains perform separately and then join in parallel and series modes. This Jupyter Notebook includes: 
•	Find user messages
•	Change message from one language to another language.
•	Develop AI pipeline
•	Join LLM chains in series
•	Join LLM chains in parallel
•	Use LangChain’s components to make end-to-end agent-like pipelines
•	Produce formatted results using structured prompts

# Main technologies: 
•	OpenAI gpt 
•	LangChain (ChatPromptTemplat. RunnableSequence, RunnableParallel, RunnablePassthrough, StrOutputParser)
•	Python(Jupyter Notebook), 
•	Anaconda Navigator
•	Prompt Engineering

# Project intent:
Key objectives for making end-to-end pipelines are:
•	Supporting queries through different languages
•	Coordinating more than one LLM pipeline in parallel
•	Sequentially connecting chains
•	Producing a systematic document without human help
•	Presenting complete workflow independence

# Main features:
•	Generating sequential chain for a four-state workflow.  
•	Layered LLM system
•	Parallel logic chain
•	Systematic prompt development
•	End-to-end report automation

# Project summary: 
This project includes:
•	Automated pipeline constructed with LLMs
•	AI system made for agentic behavior
•	NLP for diverse languages
•	Maximized prompt engineering with considering reliable performance
•	Parallel and sequential pipeline control
•	Formatted document synthesis
